    "**What is a balk?** [Pro Baseball Insider](http://probaseballinsider.com/baseball-instruction/what-is-a-balk/) has the simplest definition:\n",
    "> In the simplest sense, a balk is when the pitcher tries to intentionally deceive the hitter or runner.  It can be a flinch on the mound after the pitcher gets set, a deceptive pick off attempt, or even just as simple as dropping the ball once you become set.  There are many actions that can result in a balk.  When runners are on base and a balk is called, all the runners move up one base.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full list of the actions that consitute a balk can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balk#Balk_actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balks are rare.** Since 2000, there have only been 100-200 balks per season, which is roughly one every 12 to 24 games in a full 2430-game season.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balks are difficult to spot.** They sometimes go unnoticed. What consitutes a balk might be subjective depending on the umpire. They might even be ignored by umpires depending on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The definition of a balk has changed over time.** Throughout baseball history, there have been a number of tweaks to the balk rule. With each tweak, balk totals for the subsequent season tended to spike or dip."
