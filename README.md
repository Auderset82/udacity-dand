Projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

### P0: Find the Optimal Chopstick Length

An opportunity to get started with data analysis and receive some quick feedback about your progress.

Set up iPython notebook and commonly used data analysis libraries on your own computer. Use them to dig into the results of an experiment testing the optimal length of chopsticks and present your findings.

### P1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

### P2: Investigate a Dataset

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

### P3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply your chosen schema to the project.
